        <h2>Choice of institution</h2>
        <p>
            Picking an institution has always been one of the problems faced by students. It is really a difficult one for students. But one
            thing a student has to know is that, one's choice of institution plays an important role in his/her education.
        </p>
        <h2>Factors to consider when picking an institution</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>An institution's specialty</li>
            <li>Cost of tuition</li>
            <li>Proximity to home</li>
            <li>Ease of finding source of income in school</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>An institution's specialty</h2>
        <p>
            Every institution has strongholds in some courses while lagging in some other courses. Some schools are really good at engineering while lagging
            in some other courses. So, when picking an institution, try to make enough research about their stongholds, whether federal or state or polytechnics.
        </p>
        <h2>Cost of tuition</h2>
        <p>
            It's not a new thing to know that average parents struggle to feed the family while keeping up with the schools of their wards. It is never a really easy
            thing to do. So, when making a choice of an institution, try to stay within reach of your parent's pockets.
        </p>
        <h2>Proximity to home</h2>
        <p>
            Only if you know the stress of travelling long distances, most often during weekends, you wouldn't think of going to a very far school because you may want
            to come back home so as to take foodstuffs. Definitely, you need to come home often. The importance of going during break can't be overemphasised. You wouldn't
            want to stress and suck up your parent's pocket just becua you are travelling home.
        </p>
        <h2>Ease of finding source of income in school</h2>
        <p>
            The truth is that it is no more news that there are no jobs in the country even if one graduates. There are jobs, but they are very difficult to come by because
            there are many graduates being pushed out to the market field every year. Hence, students tend to look for viable businesses to venture into. So, ease of access into
            a business should also be a factor to consider in picking a course.
