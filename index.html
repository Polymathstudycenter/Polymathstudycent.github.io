                <h2 class="first-heading">WASSCE</h2>
                <p>West African Senior Secondary Certificate Examination has been one of the nightmares of many well-meaning Nigerian students. It is not as if the exam is quite hard, but many students lack the basic foundation to combat the intricacies of the exam. Here in Polymath Study Center, we breed students to be self-sufficient in dealing with Wassce. We provide every needed help necessary to help the students achieve their aim of acing the exam with at least 7 A's. We are not boastful but we believe in the transformation of every student that connects with us. We have efficient and qualified teachers to take you to the ivory tower. We make it happen</p>

                <h2>UTME</h2>
                <p>Having failed utme several times and having written utme(Jamb) for many years, you may have doubted if you would ever grace the four corners of the Nigerian tertiary institution. Here at Polymath Study Center, we help students achieve their goal of securing admission into any university of their choice. We breed and groom the students in whichever way, for them to be able to score a minimum of 300 in their Jamb Examination. It's not a new thing, as our students across the country would attest to the position impact we have had on them. You not only score more than 300 in Jamb, but we breed you more to ace any post-utme of any university.</p>
