        <h2>Course Guideline</h2>
        <p>Many a times, choosing a course of study proves to be a big burden and challenge to students. One of the biggest problems is that student's 
            decision of choice of course is greatly influenced by their parent's/guardian's decision.
        </p>
        <h2>factors affecting Student's choice of course are as follows</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peer pressure</li>
            <li>Course's misconception</li>
            <li>parent's or Guardian's influence</li>
            <li>The nature of society's work field</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The list is actually inexhaustive</p>
        <h2>Peer Pressure</h2>
        <p>When as a growing kid, I had this fantassy of being among the best when it comes to academics. With that in mind, some courses were tagged irrelevant by my peers.
            This is so true in our education spheres. Some courses have been assigned to the brilliant ones by the society, which in turn makes the students to think low of 
            other courses. This is quite the contrary in the western countries, across the shores.It has become a norm, for students to think high of courses like Medicine and Surgery,
            Engineering and Law, while neglecting one of the most enchanting courses like Political Science, mathematics, physics and the rest. 
        </p>
        <h2>Course's misconception</h2>
        <p>Misconception of courses proves to be one of the ill-norms of the Nigeria's education sphere. Many are disoriented from what a particular course entails.
            Many don't know even a speck about their chosen course. It all boils down to one's exposure. Just like many students might think that anyone studying mathematics in a higher
            institution, only teaches mathematics all through his life. Some may think that studying mechanical engineering is all about fixing knocked engines. The truth is that most of our 
            students  are misguided.
        </p>
        <h2>Parent's or Guardian's influence</h2>
        <p>Despite being the bedrock of a child's upbringing and social fitting, our parents or guardians have proved have an influencing hand in a child choice of course. It is not a surprise that
            because of the nature of the Nigerian state. We are in a state where our parents or guardians find spouses for their children, how much more one's choice of course. It is so unbearing that
            they would have to interfere in a child's choice of course.
        </p>
        <h2>The nature of society's work field</h2>
        <p>
            The truth is that, many a times, a child's choice of course of the parent's choice of course for their child can not blamed. This is partly due to the society we find ourselves in. We are in a state
            where an engineering graduate would be given an appointment to teach mathematics, while a mathematics graduates is being given civic education to teach. It is son bordersome that the society has to be
            the way it is. Employers contributed to this social misfit, just in the name of mystifying or placing a particular course above others. It is very appalling that it has to be this way. The job or work
            market is such that some courses are placed above others, thus warranting the students to be pushed into pickin some other courses they may not excell in.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is the possible solution to this misfit. There actually exist solutions. The following would come handy in tackling the problems at hand.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Don't let peer pressure get to you. Don't choose a course because your friends did nor because you feel that some come courses are reserved exclusively to brilliant ones.</li>
            <li>Try to understand the details of your chosen course. Make sure to ask or research about your course and everything there is inside it.</li>
            <li>Bearing in mind the parents or guardians influence, make sure not to do a course solely because the people over us told us to do. Although, they may have the best of your interests at hand.
                But, don't do because of their influence. Carefully analyse the course, to know if you have the mental capacity to go about doing the course.
            </li>
            <li>It's true that the society shapes our decision in the thingd we do, but, living a good life is all about living a fulfilled life. And living a fulfilled life entails being at peace within ourselve and the society.
                ASk if you would like to bear the consequence and burden of being frustrated at work if you finally graduate.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            In all, it's very paramount to know why you want to choose a course.
